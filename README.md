# Data-Analysis-with-Skilharvest-_

Data Analysis with Skilharvest has been a wonderful journey where I learned how to use various software for data analysis. The software I was introduced to include:

- Excel
- GitHub
- Power BI
- Google Query Sheets
Through this experience, I came to understand that data is information, and data is everywhere.
The course also provided a structured outline, which included the following key topics:

## Data Information
### Sources of Data: I learned about various ways to acquire data and information, including sources such as:
- Cloud services
- Facebook
- Excel
- Websites
- Access
- SQL

## Excel
In this section, we covered the fundamentals of using Excel, including:
- Introduction to Excel: Understanding the basic interface and tools.
- Basic Excel Functions: Learning essential formulas and functions for data manipulation, such as
  - =Sum
  - =VLOOKUP
  - =AVERAGE
  - =TRIM
  - =CONCATENATE
  - =IF and many more Functions 
- Data Foundation: Gaining a strong foundation in organizing and structuring data in Excel.
- Creating Reports in Excel: How to compile and present data effectively in reports.
- Project Challenge: Applying the knowledge gained through a practical project.

## GitHub
In GitHub, we learned how to work with code repositories and understand its role as a platform for storing and sharing code. 
We explored how to use GitHub for version control and collaboration, and how to express our work using various programming languages.

### Key topics covered in GitHub:
1. How to Download GitHub: Getting started with setting up GitHub on your computer.
2. Project Overview: Understanding the structure and goals of the project.
3. Data Sources: Identifying and working with relevant datasets.
4. Data Analysis Tools: Using tools to analyze and manipulate data.
5. Data Cleaning and Preparation: Techniques for cleaning and organizing data for analysis.
6. Exploratory Data Analysis: Initial exploration of the data to uncover patterns and insights.
7. Insights and Findings: Drawing conclusions from the analysis and interpreting results.
8. Recommendations: Providing actionable insights based on the findings.
9. References: Citing sources and tools used throughout the project.

## Google Sheets vs. Excel
Google Sheets:
Works best with an active internet connection as it saves data automatically to the cloud.
Great for collaboration and real-time updates.
Excel:
More feature-rich and versatile for offline use.
May feel more robust for advanced tasks.
I seem to prefer Excel for its independence from constant connectivity, but appreciate Google Sheets for its cloud-based convenience.

## Power BI
A powerful tool for data visualization and creating interactive dashboards.
Requires a strong system for smooth operation, as it can be resource-intensive.
Can connect to multiple data sources and is ideal for summarizing complex data.
### Power BI Components:
- Power BI Desktop: For creating dashboards on your computer.
- Power BI Mobile App: For viewing dashboards on the go.
- Power BI Services: Cloud-based services for sharing and collaboration.
### Principles of Data Visualization
- Determine the Audience: Tailor your visuals to the needs of the people viewing the data.
- Right Choice of Visualization: Match the chart type to the data and the story you're telling.
- Keep it Simple: Avoid overloading visuals with unnecessary elements.
- Choose Colors Wisely: Use colors to enhance clarity and readability, not distract.
